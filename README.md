Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), is designed to create models that can quickly adapt to new tasks or environments with minimal retraining. This algorithm is particularly
powerful in scenarios where the environment is dynamic and unpredictable. MAML is a Meta-RL algorithm that can quickly the scheduler's
policy to optimize packet transfer across paths. The scheduler doesn't just learn how to route packets in one specific scenario but learns a strategy that
works well across a wide range of network conditions.
This algorithm has been implemented in Python and Golang.
